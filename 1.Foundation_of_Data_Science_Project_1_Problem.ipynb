The data contains 41 demographic and employment related variables. The abbreviated column names provided to you below. You are expected to read the documentation of this dataset, understand the features and preprocess this dataset. Additional information can be found [in the data description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/census-income.data.html) and [additional comments](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/census-income.names).\n",
